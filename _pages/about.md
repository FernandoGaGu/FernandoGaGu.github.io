Passionate researcher with a deep focus on applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the field of Neurology, particularly in understanding and diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases. As a PhD candidate in Computer Science, I’ve dedicated my work to exploring innovative approaches in neuroimaging and speech processing, using AI to explore new insights into cognitive impairment.  I’ve contributed to numerous high-impact publications and participated in international projects, always driven by a desire to push the boundaries of medical research.
